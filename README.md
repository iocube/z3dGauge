# z3dGauge
Attempting a faux-3D HUD gauge for Assetto Corsa. Written as an in-game app and in Python.  <br />

A demo providing a good look at how early in development it still is. No graphics yet, barely functioning. Even getting the strings to show up was quite a challenge for me. Thanks to a friend called S, the RPM counter is a function instead of an ELIF (times 8) kind of deal.  <br/>

Finally added the fake 3D square, which will serve as a base.  <br />
